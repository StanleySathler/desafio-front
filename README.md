# Agrotis - Front-end Challenge

## What is this for?

This challenge was originally made for candidates who are interested on joining Agrotis team as a front-end developer.

The reason I decided to complete this challenge was for learning purposes. It is a cool project and might help me understanding better a few concepts related to the React and Redux environments.

## Running the project locally

Just type in your terminal one of the following commands:

```bash
# Using Yarn
$ yarn start

# Using npm
$ npm start
``` 

The command will start a development server as well as a new tab in your favourite browser.
